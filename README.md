# Staff list page with React

This is my first project with React. 

You can run the app with 'npm run dev'.

There are a user list and carousel, a registration form. You may click on the card with info about the user or the user's avatar in the carousel. And then you will go to the user's page with full information about them and with a comments list. Comments' list includes five last ones. You can leave a comment on this page and post requests will be saved in the state.

Also, I use Redux and Router. I will use thunk for async requests and have received the mock data with mockapi.io. The site layout is with Flex.
